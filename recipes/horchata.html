    <h3>Description</h3>
     <p>This Horchata recipe is my take on the popular favorite. It's made with rice, milk, vanilla, cinnamon, and water. It takes seconds to prep, is refreshing and absolutely delicious!</p>
     <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 1/2 cups uncooked long-grain white rice</li>
        <li>2 Mexican cinnamon sticks</li>
        <li>4 cups hot water</li>
         <li>2 cups milk, or almond milk</li>
          <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
          <li>2 teaspoons ground cinnamon</li>
          <li>â…“-1/2 cups granulated sugar , to taste</li>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>Blend: Combine the rice, hot water, and cinnamon sticks in a blender and blend until the rice and cinnamon sticks are roughly ground. Add the remaining water and blend again. Pour contents into a pitcher or container with a fitted lid and refrigerate overnight (or at least 8 hours).</li>
            <li>Strain: Pour the rice mixture into a fine mesh strainer or cheesecloth over a pitcher and discard the rice.</li>
             <li>Finish Horchata: Stir in the milk, vanilla, cinnamon, and sugar (to your preference). Chill until ready to serve. Stir well before serving and serve over ice.</li>
          </ol>
          <h3>Notes</h3>
        <p>For Vegans: To make this recipe vegan, simply substitute equal parts almond milk for the milk in the recipe.</p> <br>
          <p>Serve this with one of my favorite <a href="https://www.cookingclassy.com/churros/">Mexican snacks</a>.</p>
